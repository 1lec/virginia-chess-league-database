                Virginia Chess League Database (VCLD) is a database-driven website which records information about chess players, chess games, and results throughout multiple seasons of a local chess league in Virginia. The league has around 150 active Players, and each month, about 80 players participate in 40 Games. Through this website, it will be possible to record and look up information such as a playerâ€™s wins, losses, and draws (the Results of each game), Openings they use, or Seasons they have participated in. It will also be possible to find information about collective statistics, such as which openings are most commonly used or how many games happen in a given season.
